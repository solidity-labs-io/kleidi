# Known Issues

The following are known issues with the Kleidi system:
- if the cold signers are malicious or compromised, they can execute transactions to compromise the system if neither recovery spells or the guardian are used
- if the hot signers are malicious or compromised, they can deploy a compromised system instance on a new chain with compromised recovery spells and malicious calldata checks that allow funds to be stolen
- if DEX's are whitelisted, this opens up the ability for the hot signers to steal funds from the system via high slippage and front and back running. DEX's are not whitelisted in the system by default and will not be displayed on the frontend until significant future code is developed to safely enable this use case. For now, this is a known issue and won't fix.
- if a malicious protocol is whitelisted, this opens up the ability for hot signers to inadvernantly lose funds
- if a non-malicious but improperly configured protocol is whitelisted, this opens up the ability for hot signers to inadvernantly lose funds by using a protocol incorrectly
- fee on transfer tokens may make the actual amount of tokens sent to destinations less or more than expected, this finding is out of scope for the system
- the system only works on EVM compatible chains, does not work on chains that have not undergone the Shanghai EVM upgrade
- the system only works with contracts that have a known ABI, it does not work with contracts that have dynamic ABIs
- the return value of token transfers are unchecked, however the call to the token contract is checked, the timelock has no accounting mechanisms
- salt in the DeploymentParams struct is not used in the call to createSystemInstance, this is a known issue, but is not a security concern. The same system instance with the same parameters can only be deployed once.
- the system does not enforce that hot, cold and recovery signers are separate, this is a known issue, however this should never happen in practice as the frontend contains business logic to prevent this from happening.
- Dynamic calldata such as arrays cannot be checked with this method in the timelock as parameters can be at unpredictable indexes depending on the array length. However, parameters can be safely constructed using external modules. However, DeFi protocols that are planned to be supported on launch all have fixed size calldata, so this is not a concern.
- the `updateExpirationPeriod()` function in the Timelock contract lacks an upper bound validation, allowing it to theoretically be set to `type(uint256).max`. If a compromised Safe were to set an extremely large expiration period and fill all 100 proposal slots, it would cause arithmetic overflow in `isOperationReady()` and `isOperationExpired()` (Solidity 0.8.25 reverts on overflow), preventing proposal execution and cleanup. This would result in a denial-of-service of the proposal system. However, this requires full Safe compromise (at which point all funds are already at risk), and recovery is possible through Safe calling `cancel()` on proposals or guardian invoking `pause()` to clear all proposals. The expiration period is hardcoded to 30 days at deployment and not exposed in the UI. This is considered low severity as it requires Safe compromise and is recoverable, but represents a defense-in-depth gap that could be addressed in future versions by adding an upper bound check (e.g., `require(newPeriod <= 365 days)`).
